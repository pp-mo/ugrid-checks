Some inconsistencies now identified between this and <ugrid-conventions>/src/conformance.md

Add an advisory that different dims are used for different locations.
 - in conjunction with "not share between meshes", this should be handy
     == each location of each mesh has its _own_ unique dimension
 - TODO: checks.py code support

Add an advisory that ALL vars should have only known-allowed "cf_role"
 = "A905"
    ("timeseries_id" , "profile_id" , "trajectory_id")
    These are discrete geometry structure types

Add an advisory that

Add a REQUIREMENT that connectivities contain *exactly 1* valid name
 = "R108.a"

R307/308 should reference the _parent_ role (the reference attribute name), and *not* the connectivity cf_role attribute
