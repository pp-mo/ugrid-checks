Some inconsistencies now identified between this and <ugrid-conventions>/src/conformance.md

line numbers in "checks.py" ...

::114
    "not a vaild UGRID cf_role"
        -- see also "test_mesh_bad_cf_role"

:: 235
  "has an attribute "boundary_dimension""
  -- needs an advisory (general)

::175
  R112 is not testable -- remove

Add an advisory that different dims are used for different locations.
 - in conjunction with "not share between meshes", this should be handy
     == each location of each mesh has its _own_ unique dimension
 - TODO: checks.py code support
