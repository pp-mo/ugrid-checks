* TO FIX: missed optional connectivites from --summary
    - see : https://github.com/pp-mo/ugrid-checks/issues/20
    - also moving-point branch "summary_optional_conns"
* more code changes, coming out of Iris code
    - dimension length counting points of a face : >= 3
        --> similar other possibles ??
        ==> DON'T do this for now

* testing for CLI
    - basic
    - summary
    - ignore

* add package-installation to repo (including command-line invocation)
    - use setup.cfg
    - provide PyPI and conda builds ?

* add HTML output form, with auto-links to conformance pages

? data-value tests

Odd additional / tidying tasks
    review use of type annotations
    consider deeper testing of 'orphan' connectivities, as various errors may go wrong in this case ??
    R116/R118 could test output form for *multiple* connectivies with non-standard-dim-order


=========
PROPOSALS FOR CHANGING STATEMENT NUMBERS ...
    - pending agreement of the conformance page changes.

Some inconsistencies now identified between this and <ugrid-conventions>/src/conformance.md

    "R102.a : invalid "cf_role" of a mesh-variable"
    "not a vaild UGRID cf_role"
    "has an attribute "boundary_dimension""
     -- needs an advisory (general)
%% A105 : "boundary_dimension" is not a valid UGRID term
**ALSO***
%% A105 : "boundary_coordinates" is not a valid UGRID term
%% A105 invalid cf_role mesh attributes
%% A905 invalid cf_role terms, for any variables

::175
%%  R112 is not testable -- remove

Add an advisory that different dims are used for different locations.
 - in conjunction with "not share between meshes", this should be handy
     == each location of each mesh has its _own_ unique dimension
 - TODO: checks.py code support
A106

Add an advisory that ALL vars should have only known-allowed "cf_role"
%% A905
    including, from CF, ("timeseries_id" , "profile_id" , "trajectory_id")
        - which are "discrete geometry" structure types

Add a generic advisory about lookalike cf_roles as mesh attributes ?
    ...should not have any attributes ending in "_connectivity", "_coordinates" or "_dimension", which are not valid UGRID connectivity or coordinate attribute names
    e.g.
        - "node_node_connectivity", "node_face_connectivity"
        - "boundary_coordinates"
        - "boundary_dimension", "node_dimension"
    ?? is there space for highlighting the specific examples ?
%% A105


Add a REQUIREMENT that connectivity attributes contain *exactly 1* valid name
%%  = "R106.a"

%% R307/308 should reference the _parent_ role (the reference attribute name), and *not* the connectivity cf_role attribute

LIS...
?? R402 + R403 are effectively the same thing?
   - *NO*, because of default fill-values.
%% R404 don't say "parent" mesh
%% A402/A403 (missing + fill-value)
    -- (FUTURE) could make these **requirements**  (subject to agreement on main UGRID)
copy the connectivity rules -- LIKE ..
    * A303 any `start_index` attribute should have the same type as the connectivity variable itself
  --> same, as "A407"
%% A407

%% A904 "no data variable" should read "no netcdf variable"
